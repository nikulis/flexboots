#flexboots :boot::boot:

Flexboots is a lightweight css library for easily making layouts. It can achieve similar effects for which one might normally use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), but has some more flexibility, among other advantages. Also works well in combination with Bootstrap.

##What can it do?

Check out the [demo](http://nikulis.github.io/flexboots/demo).

flexboots provides a simple wrapper to easily set up and work with flexboxes.
> The CSS3 Flexible Box, or flexbox, is a layout mode providing for the arrangement of elements on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. For many applications, the flexible box model provides an improvement over the block model in that it does not use floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with the margins of its contents. 

> Many designers will find the flexbox model easier to use. Child elements in a flexbox can be laid out in any direction and can have flexible dimensions to adapt to the display space. Positioning child elements is thus much easier, and complex layouts can be achieved more simply and with cleaner code, as the display order of the elements is independent of their order in the source code.
